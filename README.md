# API project, Java

![img.png](img.png)

As i am learning Java in my CS studies, I wanted to learn how to impliment a API i a console app with Java. The idea was to create a simple app, that takes the input city, checks it up against a API, in this case via AccuWeather and returns if its raining or not. It was a awesome learning experience. 
## Built With
